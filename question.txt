1) Create a 128-bit and 256-bit AES key, encrypt and decrypt each of the two files using AES in the CTR mode.
2) Compute a hash of each of the files using hash functions SHA-256, SHA-512, and SHA3-256.
3) Create a 2048-bit and 3072-bit RSA key, encrypt and decrypt the files above with PKCS #1 v2 padding (at least v2.0, but v2.2 is preferred; it may also be called OAEP).
4) Create a 2048-bit and 3072-bit DSA key, sign the two files and verify the corresponding signatures. If creating a key takes two parameters, use 224 bits for the exponent sizes. If the hash function algorithm needs to specified separately, use SHA-256.

For each encryption algorithm, measure (i) the time it take to generate a new key, (ii) the time it takes to encrypt and (iii) the time it takes to decrypt each of the two files. Compute encryption and decryption speeds per byte for both of the files. Similarly, for the signature scheme, measure the key generation time and the time to produce and verify a signature for the two files (the total time and per-byte time). Finally, for the hash functions, measure the total time to compute the hash of both files and compute per-byte timings.
